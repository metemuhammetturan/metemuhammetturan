# Hi, I'm Mete Muhammet Turan 👋

> **Product Manager & Software Engineer | Builder of Scalable Digital Products**

I don’t just write code; I bridge the gap between complex technical architectures and strategic business growth. From ideation to market launch, I own the product lifecycle to build solutions that scale.
